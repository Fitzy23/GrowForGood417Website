  <h2>Our Journey into Plants</h2>
  <p>At Grow For Good 417, we believe plants have the power to brighten lives, inspire creativity, and bring people together. Located in Springfield, MO, we offer a carefully curated selection of indoor plants ranging from easy-to-care-for varieties like philodendrons and alocasia to unique finds like the Queen of the Night orchid cactus and Blizzard aloe</p>
  <br>
  <p>Our passion for plants has roots that go way back—growing up in rural Missouri to a family of educators, we didn't have a lot of money, but we had a deep connection to nature. Every season, our family would grow our own fruits and vegetables, and it was while farming with my father that I began to understand the life cycle of plants. My mother and grandmother also played a big role, bringing me along to plant-related events where I learned more about the world of greenery.</p>
  <br>
  <p>That love for plants stayed with me through college, where I became known as “the guy with all the plants.” Many of my studies were focused on botany, and this eventually led me to pursue a degree in biology. Today, I’m proud to be a professor of biology at a local college, continuing the family tradition of education while fostering a deep appreciation for the natural world.</p>
  <br>
  <p>During the pandemic, I decided to take on a new challenge—building a greenhouse. This project, born from a need to grow something during those uncertain times, blossomed into an opportunity to turn my lifelong passion into a business. In 2021, we officially launched, offering not just plants, but also knowledge and community.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Our mission is more than just selling plants—we're here to share our obsession with our community. That's why we participate in local events, host fun activities like plant swaps, and partner with businesses like Schofield & Gray and Artistree Pottery to create experiences that blend art and nature. We’re proud to donate a portion of our sales to causes close to our hearts, including Convoy of Hope for hurricane relief and Alzheimer's research.</p>
  <br>
  <p>With a strong focus on education (I’m also a teacher!), we love helping our customers learn how to care for plants and bring greenery into their homes and workspaces. We offer special deals for students and educators and host "Planty Happy Hour" specials to make it easy and fun for everyone to enjoy plant life.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Whether you're a seasoned plant lover or just starting your collection, we’re here to help make your space come alive with the beauty and benefits of plants. Come visit us, meet our team, and let us help make our plant obsession your plant obsession!</p>
