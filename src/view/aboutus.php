  <h2>Grow for Good 417, LLC was started in 2021 focusing on plants and plant education. Growing up in rural Missouri to a family of educators, we did not have a lot of money. Each season our family grew our own produce. Farming with my father taught me an understanding of plants. Volunteering with my mom and grandmother at plant-related events played a role in my plant education. In college, I was the guy with all the plants. Many of my classes were focused on botany, leading me to a degree in biology, and I am currently a professor of biology at a local college. These experiences all culminated in a lifelong passion for plants and sharing them with others. 
      My ‘Pandemic Project’ was to build a greenhouse, providing the perfect opportunity to start a plant business in 2021. 
      Grow For Good 417 creates Garden Art pieces. We find unique containers at flea markets and thrift stores to repurpose and pair with the perfect plant, creating a piece of art that our customers proudly display in their home or office! 
      We work with local businesses to throw Plant pARTy classes and pass along the knowledge I have received to future green thumbs. People have fun, learn about plants, get together with friends, and create their own pieces of Garden Art.</h2><BR>
